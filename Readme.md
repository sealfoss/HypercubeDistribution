I'm switching to SideQuestVR distribution. Newer releases can be found at the following link:
https://sidequestvr.com/app/26589/hypercube

This is the distribution repo for Hypercube, an AR passthrough application for Meta Quest 3.

This application uses pointer controls via your hands (no controllers).
This application uses AR passthough.

The login screen is pretty self explainatory. 
Login requires creating an account if you don't already have one.
You will need to verify your email address before the app will work.
Upon successful login, an encrypted password file is written to the device.
You shouldn't need to login again afterwards, until you reinstall the app.

Once you're logged in, simply look at the Hypercube to get his attention.
Simply state your request or question, and Hypercube will answer you as best as possible.
If you don't need anything, the request will time out after a few seconds so just go about your business.

If you would like Hypercube to look at something for you and tell you what it thinks,
you'll need to take a screenshot of it first using the Meta Quest menu.
Once you've taken your screen shot, say to hyper cube something along the lines 
of "I'd like you to look at this image for me", followed by any statements about what you'd
like Hypercube to find for you in the image or any information you'd like Hypercube to find
about the image contents. This request will take a while, so please be patient for
Hypercube to get back to you.

If you would like to leave feed back, tell Hypercube something along the lines of
"I'd like to leave some feedback." Hypercube will prompt you for your comments and
these comments will be recorded in our database. Please please please, by all means tell us what
we can do to make this application better.
